Repo of my game used for Mobile Computin Course.
The game is called "Mask On!" which is an endless run with joystick control where the player has to dodge the object and over time you gain a score,
after you lose your score will be registered on our rank system and if you will be on the top 10 you'll see it.
There is an login operation, so, in order to play you must be registered with an email. 


Thats a short vid of gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qP1sQlq8Rk
